FlowCal is a library for reading, analyzing, and calibrating flow cytometry data in Python. It features:

Extraction of Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files into numpy array-like structures
Traditional and non-standard gating, including automatic density-based two-dimensional gating.
Transformation functions that allow conversion of data from raw FCS channel numbers to arbitrary fluorescence units (a.u.).
Plotting, including generation of histograms, density plots and scatter plots.

FlowCal automatically processes calibration beads data in order to convert fluorescence to calibrated units, 
Molecules of Equivalent Fluorophore (MEF). The most important advantages of using MEF are:
    1) fluorescence can be reported independently of acquisition settings
    2) variation in data due to instrument shift is eliminated

READING FLOW CYTOMETRY DATA

# opens the file sample006.fcs from the FCFiles folder, 
# loads the information into an FCSData object, and assigns it to a variable s.
s = FlowCal.io.FCSData('FCFiles/sample006.fcs')
